RFCs
        How the Internet works is all written down in RFCs
        Anyone can read them
        Anyone can implement them
        This is a Good Thing
        This is why Microsoft does not run the Internet
        This is also why when you write HTML to "whatever works in IE" baby Stallman cries.

        They are handled by the IETF
        Anyone can publish an RFC
        And they do
        The IETF just decides what's a "standard"
        This is why Microsoft does not own the Internet


HTTP
        HyperText Transfer Protocol
        for HyperText Markup Language
        but really it can transport anything
        and tends to
        because its so simple
        and cheap

        Web browser connects to a web server
        Says "Hi, foo.com.  I'm speaking HTTP version 1.1"
        I would like the document /foo/bar
        I can understand these languages...
        And now I'm done speaking.

        Web server says back
        Ok, your document is thiiiiis biiiiig.
        Its this sort of document.
        Here it is.
        Or
        Your document is over here.
        Try that instead
        Or
        You can't have it
        Or
        I fucked up

        Then, if the document is HTML, it looks in it for more documents.
        Like CSS, Javascript and images.
        And it has the same conversation above for each of them.

        Status codes
        200 OK
        3xx Redirect
        4xx Denied
        5xx Error


HTTP Your Mom Jokes

* 402 Payment Required

* 413 Request Entity Too Large (that's what your sister said)
* 416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable (that's your dad said)

* 418 I'm a teapot


Ports
        Like mailboxes in an apartment
        This is how one computer can run multiple services
        Mail server (port 25, 143, 110)
        ssh (22)
        HTTP (80)
        HTTPS (443)
        FTP (20 and 21)
        DNS (53)
        http://www.google.com means "contact port 80 on www.google.com"

        This is also why you don't need to put "www" on the front of everything
        and it still works.

        Firewalls often block by port (its easy) without looking at content (hard)
        So blocking port 25 means you can't send mail.
        But you don't HAVE to run your mail server on port 25.
        Its just convention.
        So you can run a mail server on port 26 and get around most firewalls.

        Some firewalls block all ports but a select few.  Usually HTTP, HTTPS and DNS.
        Which is why I run an SSH server on one of those ports.  Nobody blocks them.
        Then you can tunnel everything over SSH.
        Which is another story.


TCP
        Transmission Control Protocol
        70s technology

        Your document is torn up into pieces
        Each of these is a "window" or a "packet"
        The packet size can be anywhere from 2 bytes to 1 gig
        This is negociated between the two ends

        Each says who is from and where its going
        And what port
        This lets it get passed along by the Internet

        Then they get numbered and sent
        The receiver acknolwedges what it got
        If it didn't get it, the sender tries again
        And again
        Waiting a little longer each time
        This lets TCP work over flakey networks
        It guarantees delivery


UDP
        User Datagram Protocol
        Much simpler than TCP
        No reliability
        There's none of the back and forth of TCP
        Stuff just gets flung out there
        And if it doesn't get received, oh well

        Good for streaming
        Or anything where if data is lost there's no sense resending it
        Video
        Voice
        Music
        Games

        Also good for things which have to be really small and fast
        DNS
        DHCP
        SNMP
        RIP


IP Address
IPv4
IPv6
DHCP
DNS
NAT

                (translator)     (NAT)
Network line -> Modem ->        Router -> WAP -> Wireless Computers
                                  ------->       Wired Computers
